Based on Matt Mullenweg's "Hello, Dolly." Instead of the lyrics from Louis Armstrong's Hello, Dolly you get Navi's quotes.

== Description ==

As a first plugin I took an existing one and modified it. The Hello Dolly plugin was the perfect place to start. All of the lyrics have been replaced with THE quote (and all other) from Navi from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. While wandering the admin pages of your wordpress installation you will be accompanied by these famous words. Most of the time Navi won't see anything interesting but it's still a laugh if you're familiar with the game. And if your not, you're missing out on a classic.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `hello_navi.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this plugin do? =
Nothing important, that's for sure. You just get these little quotes at the top of every admin page. It's not visible to the public anywhere on your site. It's for your own pleasure.

= Who is Arthur Brugiere? =
A french guy that enjoys video games, really wants to be a game developper, loves coffee, caffeine, and beer, and will one day make a good game.

== Screenshots ==

1. This is a screen shot of one randomly selected lines of many said by Navi in the game The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. It corresponds to screenshot-1.jpg.
